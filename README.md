## Thanks
I tried to find an extension to move the position of the  notification banner from the center to the right side of the screen and ended up find [this](https://github.com/brunodrugowick/notification-position-gnome-extension).

But it wasn't compatible with Gnome 40 at the time. So I decided to take a look at [the repo](https://github.com/brunodrugowick/notification-position-gnome-extension) and create my own extension.

## Feedback
This extension isn't perfect therefore suggestions/improvements are always [welcome](https://gitlab.com/sudo_TuX/gnoti/-/issues)!
